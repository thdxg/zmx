# macOS attributes privacy-gated operations (Local Network, TCC) to a process's
# *responsible process*, a value fixed at spawn and inherited from the parent.
# The daemon re-execs itself disclaimed (daemonize.reexecDisclaimed) so that it,
# and not the terminal that ran `zmx attach`, is the responsible process for
# everything in the session -- and stays so after that terminal exits. These
# tests pin that contract. The semantics are Darwin-only, so they skip elsewhere.
